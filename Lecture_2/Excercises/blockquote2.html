    <blockquote cite="https://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/john-lennon/truth-behind-john-lennon-happy-quote/#:~:text=%22When%20I%20was%205%20years,didn%27t%20understand%20life.%22">
        When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy'. They told me I didn't understand the assignment, and I told them they didn't understand life.
