    <h2>About the movie</h2>
    <p> Miner turn oilman Daniel Plainview is a driven man who will do whatever it takes to achieve his goals. <br>
        He works hard but he also takes advantage of those around him at their expense if need be. <br>
        His business partner is his son H.W., who in reality he "acquired" when H.W.'s biological single father, who worked on one of Daniel's rigs, got killed in a workplace accident. <br>
        Daniel is deeply protective of H.W. if only for what H.W. brings to the partnership. </p>
